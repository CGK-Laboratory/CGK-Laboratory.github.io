The lab uses a preclinical rodent model to understand how an acute stressful event can lead to addiction, not only facilitating drug self-administration but also precipitating relapse.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Welcoming UBA Engineering Students to CGKLab</title><link href="https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2025/05/25/UBA-Engineering-Students.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcoming UBA Engineering Students to CGKLab" /><published>2025-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-04T00:20:20+00:00</updated><id>https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2025/05/25/UBA-Engineering-Students</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2025/05/25/UBA-Engineering-Students.html"><![CDATA[<p>Weâ€™re thrilled to host six Computer Engineering students from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) as they complete their year-long Capstone Projects ðŸ’»</p>

<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>CellSelect adds the possibility to select full cells that we want to continue with the analysis and eliminate the incomplete ones (for example cells in the x, y, or z border).</p>

<p>Also, in our GitHub repository, you can find a Calcium Imaging Pipeline using Jupyter notebook and their new updates. https://github.com/CGK-Laboratory.</p>]]></content><author><name>constanza-garcia-keller</name></author><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CGK lab is excited to launch ðŸš€ today our GitHub, featuring CellSelect-3DMorph.
