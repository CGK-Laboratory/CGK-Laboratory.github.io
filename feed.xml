The lab uses a preclinical rodent model to understand how an acute stressful event can lead to addiction, not only facilitating drug self-administration but also precipitating relapse.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Juan’s first 1st author publication</title><link href="https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2025/09/02/juan-first-paper.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Juan’s first 1st author publication" /><published>2025-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-06T09:50:14+00:00</updated><id>https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2025/09/02/juan-first-paper</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2025/09/02/juan-first-paper.html"><![CDATA[<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>CGK lab is excited to launch 🚀 today our GitHub, featuring CellSelect-3DMorph. A forked code from its predecessor 3DMorph that reconstructs cells from 3D images and analyzes their morphology! 🔬

<p>CellSelect adds the possibility to select full cells that we want to continue with the analysis and eliminate the incomplete ones (for example cells in the x, y, or z border).</p>

<p>Also, in our GitHub repository, you can find a Calcium Imaging Pipeline using Jupyter notebook and their new updates. https://github.com/CGK-Laboratory.</p>]]></content><author><name>constanza-garcia-keller</name></author><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CGK lab is excited to launch 🚀 today our GitHub, featuring CellSelect-3DMorph.
