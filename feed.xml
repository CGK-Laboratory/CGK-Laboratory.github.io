The lab uses a preclinical rodent model to understand how an acute stressful event can lead to addiction, not only facilitating drug self-administration but also precipitating relapse.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Congrats to Juan Taborda for SFN award</title><link href="https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2024/09/06/Congrats-to-Juan.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Congrats to Juan Taborda for SFN award" /><published>2024-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-04T01:05:28+00:00</updated><id>https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2024/09/06/Congrats-to-Juan</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cgk-laboratory.github.io/2024/09/06/Congrats-to-Juan.html"><![CDATA[<p>Congrats <a href="/members/Juan-pablo-taborda">Juan Taborda</a> for been selected for the @SfNtweets Trainee professional development award this year to attend Neurocience2024 meeting.

<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>CellSelect adds the possibility to select full cells that we want to continue with the analysis and eliminate the incomplete ones (for example cells in the x, y, or z border).</p>

<p>Also, in our GitHub repository, you can find a Calcium Imaging Pipeline using Jupyter notebook and their new updates. https://github.com/CGK-Laboratory.</p>]]></content><author><name>constanza-garcia-keller</name></author><category term="software" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CGK lab is excited to launch ðŸš€ today our GitHub, featuring CellSelect-3DMorph.
