<!-- excerpt start -->
CGK lab is excited to launch ðŸš€ today our GitHub, featuring CellSelect-3DMorph. A forked code from its predecessor 3DMorph that reconstructs cells from 3D images and analyzes their morphology! ðŸ”¬ 
[CellSelect_3DMorph](https://github.com/CGK-Laboratory/CellSelect_3DMorph)
<!-- excerpt end -->

CellSelect adds the possibility to select full cells that we want to continue with the analysis and eliminate the incomplete ones (for example cells in the x, y, or z border).

 Also, in our GitHub repository, you can find a Calcium Imaging Pipeline using Jupyter notebook and their new updates. https://github.com/CGK-Laboratory.
