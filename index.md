# Garcia Keller laboratory

## Area of Focus: 

Reveal the neurobiological underpinnings of substance use disorders and anxiety disorders such as PTSD. We focus on the long-lasting changes in brain function produced by drug use and a single strong stress that create the enduring vulnerability to environmental cues producing relapse to drug use or stress-associated behaviors.

## Research Interests

The long-term goal of the Garcia Keller laboratory is to identify the neurological mechanisms that underlie stress-induced vulnerability in the development of substance use disorders (SUDs), and in doing so, rationally design pharmacotherapeutic treatments. Converging epidemiological studies indicate that a history of acute life-threatening events increases the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a diagnosis of PTSD carries 30-50% comorbidity with SUDs. Such comorbidity results in greater drug use and poorer treatment outcomes. The lab uses a preclinical rodent model to understand how an acute stressful event can lead to addiction, not only facilitating drug self-administration but also precipitating relapse.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

1. understand the neurocircuitry and cell-type specificity involved in stress and addiction using calcium imaging.
2. study the role of the pentapartite synapse in stress and addiction, first focusing in microglia's role.
3. study novel therapeutic treatments for PSTD and SUD targeting key genes/proteins of interest.

The Garcia Keller laboratory develops and shares open source tools to advance neuroscience research. We believe open source practices are essential for:

- Reproducibility: Allowing others to verify and build upon our findings

- Collaboration: Facilitating partnerships across research institutions

- Accessibility: Reducing cost barriers for laboratories with limited resources
