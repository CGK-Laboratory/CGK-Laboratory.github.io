  description: CellSelect-3DMorph reconstructs cells from fluorescent pixel data, providing key parameters such as cell volume, territorial volume, ramification index, branch length, and the number of branches and endpoints. It builds on the 3D Morph code, adding the ability to exclude incomplete cells from analysis, ensuring accurate morphological calculations.
