Pronouns: he, him, his. 

Juan Pablo joined the medical college of Wisconsin as a neuroscience doctoral program student in 2022 and join the CGK lab in February of 2023. Juan graduated from Baldwin Wallace university, Berea, OH in May 2022 with a bachelor’s degree in neuroscience and biology. During his undergrad he worked under the mentorship of Dr. Clare Mathes, where he researched the early-life effects of artificial sweeteners in taste behavior and reward circuitry. His interest in reward-circuitry and substance abuse research led him to join the CGK lab. In his free time Juan loves to play volleyball, discover new breweries, cook meals from his home country (Colombia) and hiking.

##### What animal would you be?

I would like to be a white tiger, it has been my favorite animal since childhood.  

##### What superpower would you have?
Stopping time is the best superpower it will allow me to get everything done when it needs to be done!

##### What would your alternative career be?
If I hadn’t gone into natural sciences I would have probably tried to be a professional editor, it was a cool hobby I had when I was younger and to time to time I like to revisit videos that I’ve done.
