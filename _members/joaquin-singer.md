##### What animal would you be?
A dolphin. I would probably leave Earth one day with the rest of them. So long, and thanks for all the fish.

##### What superpower would you have?
I would love to have the power to see people’s stats floating above their heads, like how many times I’ve crossed paths with them, how many hours they slept last night, or what song they’ve listened to the most this week.

##### What would your alternative career be?
Professional podcaster.
