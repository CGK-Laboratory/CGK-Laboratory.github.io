My name is Kaitlyn Rhyner (she/her), and I am excited to have joined the Garcia-Keller Lab this year as a second year graduate student in the Pharmacology and Toxicology department at MCW! I am a 2023 graduate from UW-Milwaukee (UWM) where I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Neuroscience and General Biology with a Chemistry minor. In the Garcia-Keller Lab, my project seeks to examine the use of psychedelic DOI 5-HT2A agonist as a potential therapeutic for symptoms associated with acute stress. My long-term career goal is to study how internal molecular interactions in neural circuitry influence external organism behavior specifically in stress.
