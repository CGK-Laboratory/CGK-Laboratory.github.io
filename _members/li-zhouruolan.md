Zhouruolan (Angela) Li is a first-year MSTP student rotating in the Garcia Keller Lab. She graduated from the Ohio State University with Honors and Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience. During her undergrad and gap years she worked under the mentorship of Dr. Min Zhou, where she studied astrocyte physiology, through the lens of viewing them in a syncytium/network. Her interests in astrocyte’s role in stress and the reward pathway led her to rotate in the CGK lab. She is hoping to bring her previous experience to the lab, and interested in utilizing in-vivo Ca2+ imaging to further study astrocytes under stress. In her free time, Angela loves to dance, draw, paint, sing, cook, workout and hike.
