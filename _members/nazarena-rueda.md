I’m a software engineer who is eager to solve real-life problems through software development. I thrive to meet different people and work collaboratively across a variety of fields. I have +5 years experience working in the software industry and currently I’ve had the opportunity to complete my final project’s degree by working with Garcia-Keller Lab. One of my goals is, not only to deliver a solution which helps the laboratory, but also to get close to the research & development aspect of my professional career.

A Horse. I guess I admire the strength and peace they transmit.

I would like to easily transport anywhere. Especially because of my insatiable need to travel.

Either being a vet or working in an ONG which allows me to be close to helping animals.
