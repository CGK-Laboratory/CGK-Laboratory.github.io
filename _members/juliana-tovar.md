My name is Juliana Tovar and I joined the Medical College of Wisconsin as a Lab Aide in the fall of 2025. Previously, I was a part of the MCW Summer Program for Undergraduates in 2023, where I first joined the CGK lab. During this time, I studied the role of microglia in acute stress and addiction. I am a 2025 graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) where I completed my Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology with a Chemistry minor. My plan is to begin medical school in the fall of 2026 and I look forward to continuing to pursue my research interests as a medical student.
