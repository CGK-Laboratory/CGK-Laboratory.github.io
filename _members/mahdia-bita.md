## Inside the Minds of our Team {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-comments" %}

##### What animal would you be?
A dolphin! They are super smart, and I really want to try breathing H<sub>2</sub>O.

##### What superpower would you have?
As a dolphin, my chosen superpower would be the ability to speak, using my voice to advocate for the ocean and all the life it sustains.

##### What would your alternative career be?
My alternative career would be as an author or poet. Writing has always been the way I make sense of the world, and I love how words can move people just as deeply as science can heal them.
