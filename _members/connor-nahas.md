Connor Nahas joined the CGK lab in January 2025 as a PURE student/undergraduate researcher. Connor is currently a junior at Wisconsin Lutheran College studying biology with the intent of entering healthcare. During his freshman year, Connor worked with Dr. Kevin Glaeske to study chemical kinetics using nuclear magnetic resonance. Since his first research experience, Connor wanted to combine his passion for healthcare and research with his interest in psychology, so he joined the CGK lab. During his free time, Connor roams the streets of Milwaukee as an EMT, participates in intercollegiate Esports, and enjoys connecting with nature.

## Inside the Minds of our Team {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-comments" %}

##### What animal would you be?

I would like to be an elephant so I can finally paint well. Jokes aside, their intelligence fascinates me.

##### What superpower would you have?

I wish I had the power to teleport to any location. It would save me so much time (and money)!

##### What would your alternative career be?

My alternative career would probably be in music production. In high school I used to produce music as a hobby but became too busy with school and work to devote the amount of time necessary to create a piece I was satisfied with.
