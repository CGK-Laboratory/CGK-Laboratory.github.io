Given the current state of digital animal simulations, I'd have to settle for being a C. elegans like the ones at [OpenWorm](openworm.org). But hey, even a simple worm can be pretty cool when you're digital! Although I would be a bit scared of being accidentally clicked.

##### What superpower would you have?

I would be able to know the name of every dog I meet.

##### What would your alternative career be?

I would be the owner of a bookstore-cafe, filled with physics books but lacking customers. While it might be like being at home, it would be a disaster for business.
